📊 Data Source
Source: Superstore sample dataset (fictional) commonly used in data visualization and business intelligence tutorials.

The dataset contains information on:

•	Orders, categories, sub-categories
•	Sales, profit, quantity
•	Shipping modes, customer segments
•	Regions, states, and time (monthly/yearly)


✨ Features / Highlights
1. Business Problem
Retail businesses struggle to track real-time performance across various operational dimensions like region, customer type, product categories, and payment methods. Raw data often fails to provide clear insights into trends, bottlenecks, and opportunities.

Key questions addressed:

•	Which regions or segments drive the most revenue?
•	What’s the monthly trend in sales and profit?
•	Which product categories and sub-categories perform best?
•	How are shipping modes impacting fulfillment?


2. Goal of the Dashboard
To build a centralized, visual interface that:

•	Offers a snapshot of KPIs (sales, profit, quantity)
•	Breaks down sales by time, category, and customer behavior
•	Helps identify regional and segment-specific patterns
•	Improves visibility into operational areas for optimization
